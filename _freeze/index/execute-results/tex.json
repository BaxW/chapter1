Introgression is common among inter-fertile species of\nforest trees, and in many cases, is hypothesized to be an adaptive\nprocess, through which genetic variation related to locally-adaptive\nphenotypes is passed from one species to the other [@suarez2018adaptive;\n@leroy2020adaptive; @rendon2021adaptive; @hamilton2016adaptive] Support\nfor this hypothesis requires a clearer understanding of the nature of\ngenetic variation that is exchanged between species, and the degree to\nwhich this variation is involved in adaptive processes in natural\npopulations. Characterization of the genetic variation involved in\nadaptive introgression would shed light on the evolutionary forces that\ninfluence the content of admixed genomes and help reveal the loci that\nunderlie both the adaptive traits and genetic incompatibilities that\nshape species boundaries.\n\nThe majority of past research on adaptive introgression has focused on\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indels, but structural\nvariation (SV) is also likely to play a role in adaptive introgression.\nSV, which includes deletions, duplications, inversions, and\ntranslocations of DNA segments, can have a significant impact on gene\nexpression, gene function, and ultimately, adaptive phenotypic\nvariation. For this reason, SV is known to be a major source of genetic\nvariation in many species, and has been implicated in the evolution of\nadaptive traits in a variety of taxa [@hamala2021genomic;\n@songsomboon2021genomic; @li2024pan; @li2023pig]. As the notion that SV\nis involved in adaptive evolution gains support, it is only logical to\nask is how SV is involved in adaptive introgression. Recent research\nsuggests that SV may play an important role in both adaptive\nintrogression [@almarri2020population; @xia2023structural;\n@zhang2021pan] and in the maintenance of species boundaries\n[@zhang2021important] in natural systems. Introgression between crop\nvarietals and wild relatives has been a key factor in the breeding\nhistory of many crops, and recent work shows that SV are often the\ncasual variants involved in this process [@gao2019tomato;\n@kou2020evolutionary; @cheng2019frequent; Sun et al., 2020; Qiao et al.,\n2021; Zanini et al., 2021 ]. While the significant effect of\nintrogressed SV on economically important crop traits is well\nrecognized, far less in known about the relationship between\nintrogression, SV and ecologically important traits in natural hybrid\nzones.\n\nThe study of SV in natural hybrid zones is challenging, as it requires\nthe ability to accurately genotype SV in a large number of admixed\nindividuals. The majority of past research on SV in natural populations\nhas relied on reference genomes that represent only one species, which\ncan lead to reference bias. Reference bias occurs when the genomes of re\nsequenced individuals contain regions that are highly diverged from the\nreference genome , causing reads originating from these regions to align\nincorrectly, or not align at all to the reference genome. This can lead\nto misinterpretation or under-representation of variation resulting from\nadmixture [@secomandi2025pangenome]. Reference bias is particularly\nproblematic when studying SV, as large insertions and deletions may be\nlonger than sequencing reads, making variation in their presence and\nabsence (PAV) challenging to detect. Furthermore, SV is often\nspecies-specific and, because admixed individuals represent a mosaic of\ngenetic variation from two or more species, the presence of reference\nbias can obscure the effect that the presence (or absence) of genetic\nvariation has on traits, and can hinder the identification of SV that is\ninvolved in introgression.\n\nRecently, an increasing number of studies have relied on pan-genome\nassembly to overcome reference bias and to accurately genotype SV\n[@secomandi2025pangenome; @gao2019tomato; @li2023pig; @li2024pan;\n@songsomboon2021genomic]. A pan-genome assembly is a non-redundant\ncollection of sequences originating from multiple individuals. This\ngenetic information can be represented as \"nodes\" in a pan-genome graph,\nwhile the linear sequence of each input genome is stored as a \"path\"\nconnecting a series of nodes. In a pan-genome graph, each node describes\nthe alignment between at least two sequences, given an expected level of\nsequence divergence. Pan-genome graphs can capture complex variation\nthat is not present in a single reference genome, and can provide a more\naccurate representation of the genetic variation present in admixed\nindividuals. Pan-genome assembly has been used to identify and genotype\nSV related to ecologically and economically important traits in a\nvariety of taxa, and has been shown to be an effective tool for studying\nthe adaptive evolution in natural populations [@secomandi2025pangenome;\n@fang2024fitness]. However, to our knowledge, no studies have used\npan-genome assembly to examine introgression in the context of forest\ntree hybrid zones, which are often dynamic and geographically broad.\nPan-genome assembly could help overcome the challenges of studying SV in\nadmixed tree genotypes, and could provide new insights into the role of\nSV in adaptive introgression in natural populations of forest trees.\n\n*Populus balsamifera* and *Populus trichocarpa* are two species of\nforest tree that readily interbreed in nature, and early and advanced\ngeneration hybrids have been described in hybrid zones located where\ntheir ranges overlap (Geraldes et al., 2014; Suarez-Gonzalez et\nal.,2016; 2018; Chhatre et al. 2019). It has previously been\nhypothesized that hybridization between these two species contributes to\nan adaptive process, through which genetic variation related to\nlocally-adaptive phenotypes is passed from one species to the other\nthrough adaptive introgression (Suarez-Gonzalez et al., 2016;\nSuarez-Gonzalez et al., 2018). However, studies on inter-specific\ncrosses in *Populus* have made it clear that introgression is often\nbiased toward particular regions of the genome, particular *Populus*\nspecies, or specific environments (Lexer et al., 2005; Thompson et al.,\n2010; Meirmans et al., 2017). Therefore, the adaptiveness of\nintrogression between *P. balsamifera* and *P. trichocarpa* is dependent\non incompatibilities between the genomic variants involved as well as\nenvironmental context, two factors which warrant further investigation.\nThe environmental context of adaptive introgression may be of particular\nimportance in the case of *P. balsamifera* and *P. trichocarpa*. *P.\nbalsamifera* is more commonly found in colder, continental climates\nwhile *P. trichocarpa* is more often associated with milder, coastal\nclimates with longer growing seasons (Geraldes et al., 2014;\nSuarez-Gonzalez et al., 2018). Considering hybrid zones between these\nspecies often fall along the boundaries of their ranges, it seems\npossible that adaptive introgression helps hybrid individuals persist in\nenvironments that are outside of the optimum for either parental\nspecies. Suarez-Gonzalez et al. (2018) showed support for this\nhypothesis, finding that introgressed regions in the genomes of hybrids\nfrom these zones harbored signs of selection and variation associated\nwith adaptive traits, including phenology. However, the specific\nadaptive variants within these genomic regions, and the nature of their\neffects on fitness remain, for the most part, undiscovered.\n\nHere, we take advantage of recent advances in pan-genome assembly\nmethods to produce a pan-genomic reference, comprising 24 diverse\nhaplotypes from *P. balsamifera*, *P. trichocarpa* and their hybrids,\nfacilitating unbiased analysis of the sequence variation that is\nsegregating within natural *Populus* hybrid zones. Using this new pan\ngenomic assembly, we genotype structural variation across 575\nindividuals sampled from within and outside of natural *P. balsamifera*\nand *P. trichocarpa* hybrid zones. We assess the true extent of genomic\ndiversity present in these species and their hybrids, identifying\ngenomic variation that is not present in the *P. trichocarpa* reference\ngenome. Furthermore, we describe structural variation involved both in\nintrogression and in genomic divergence between the two species. We shed\nlight on the role that introgression may play in shaping the pan-genome\nof these species, and the degree to which tree genomes are porous to the\ninter-specific exchange of structural variant alleles.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Sample collection and whole genome sequencing\n\nIn January 2020, we collected dormant branch cuttings from 546 poplar\ntrees along 7 distinct latitudinal transects spanning natural contact\nzones between Populus trichocarpa and Populus balsamifera @fig-1. Short\nread whole genome sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analyses were\nperformed as described in Bolte et al. (2024). Briefly, Genomic DNA\nlibraries for all sampled individuals were constructed at the Duke\nUniversity Center for Genomic and Computational Biology and sequenced\nusing an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument with an S4 flow cell in\n2 × 150 bp format with 64 samples per lane (Illumina Inc., San Diego,\nUSA). De-indexing, QC, trimming adapter sequences, and sequence\npre-processing were completed by the sequencing facility. In addition to\nshort read sequencing, we also sequenced a subset of 40 sampled\nindividuals with PacBio HiFi long reads. We harvested tissue from\nnewly-expanded leaves grown under low light conditions to use for high\nmolecular weight DNA extraction. After confirming extraction quality\nthrough gel electrophoresis and bioanalysis, we submitted HMW DNA to the\nUniversity of Maryland Center for Integrative Biosciences Genomics Core\nFacility for library preparation and sequencing on the the PacBio Sequel\nsystem with two samples per SMRT flow cell. We sequenced one *P.\nbalsamifera* sample (939) for an additional run on a full SMRT cell. We\nalso sequenced this individual with Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)\nplatform. We submitted high molecular weight DNA to the Vermont\nIntegrative Genomics Resource Sequencing Center for library preparation\nand sequencing on XXX flowcell (two runs) and XXX flowcell (one run)\n\n### Genome assembly\n\nOf the 40 individuals sequenced with HiFi long reads, we selected 16 for\nwhole genome assembly (Figure1b). These samples ranged from 20 to 35x\nlong read coverage. We performed de-novo genome assembly of the HiFi\nreads for these samples with HiCanu [@nurk2020hicanu]. We set HiCanu\nparameters as follows: gSize=\"400m\", lc=\"5\", lcer=\"0.055\", ovrlp=\"350\",\nmincov=\"9\". To detect potential contaminants in the raw assemblies\nproduced by HiCanu, we used the program Kraken2 to compare the k-mer\ncontent of assembled contigs to the \"PlusPFP\" database of known\ntaxon-specific k-mers representing archaea, bacteria, viral, human,\nprotozoa, fungi and plant taxa [@lu2022]. We then used a custom bioawk\nscript to remove any assembled contig that Kraken2 assigned to a\ntaxonomic unit other than \\*Populus\\*, leaving only unassigned or\n\\*Populus\\*- assigned contigs in each assembly. We assessed the accuracy\nand completeness of the decontaminated assemblies using QUAST and BUSCO\n[@gurevich2013quast; @simao2015busco]. To further assess the contiguity\nand quality of these assemblies, we used minimap2 and BWA to map the\noriginal HiFi reads and additional Illumina short reads back to each\nassembled haplotype [@li2018minimap2; @li2010fast]. We passed these\nalignments to the program CRAQ [@li2023identification], which leverages\nread depth along assembled contigs for quality assessment. We repeated\nthese quality assessment checks at each subsequent stage of genome\nassembly. Phasing, or the separation and concatenation of contigs\nbelonging to the same parental haplotype is a key step in genome\nassembly for hybrid individuals, as divergent haplotypes likely contain\nimportant genetic information. We used mininmap2 to map reads back to\nassembled contigs and to map assembled contigs to themselves. We then\nused the purge_haplotigs pipeline (Roach et al., 2018) to split diploid\nassemblies into two assembled haploytpes for each individual. We used\nRagTag (Alonge et al. 2022) to connect decontaminated, phased contigs\ninto pseudo-chromosomal scaffolds, guided by alignments of assembled\ncontigs to the Nisqually1 *P. trichocarpa* reference genome. We visually\ninspected minimap2 alignments of scaffolded assemblies to the reference\ngenome to identify potential scaffolding errors. We used RepeatMasker to\nannotate and mask repetitive regions and annotated possible coding\ndomains and predicted protein sequences for each assembly with AUGUSTUS\n(Smit et al., 2015; Hoff et al., 2019).\n\n### Pan-genome assembly\n\nIn a pan-genome graph, a non-redundant collection of all input sequences\nis represented as “nodes”, while the linear sequence of each input\ngenome is stored as a “path” connecting a series of nodes. In this\napproach to graph construction, each node of the graph w describes the\nalignment between at least two sequences, given an expected level of\nsequence divergence. We constructed a pan-genome graph from an all-by\nall alignment of the 24 assembled haplotypes. Any contigs shorter than\n100kb were dropped before alignment. We used wfmash (Guarracino et al.,\n2021) to perform all-by-all alignments between assembled chromosomes,\nand seqwish (Garrison & Guarracino, 2022) to project alignments into a\ngraph pan-genome assembly. Pan-genome graphs constructed this way can\nhave highly complex topography, which may hinder downstream applications\nsuch a sequence alignment. To combat this issue, we used the program\nsmoothXG to smooth complex variation in these graphs. We also assembled\na separate graph specifically for subsequent alignment-based analyses\nusing the minigraph-cactus pipeline [@hickey2023]. We used the program\npanacus to asses pan-genome growth and coverage statistics\n[@parmigiani2024]. We used the program ODGI (Guarracino et al., 2022) to\nperform basic graph quality control and to partition the core ( sequence\npresent in all individuals), shell (sequence variably present or absent\nacross individuals) and singleton sequence (present in only one\nindividuals) content for each graph and individual represented in the\ngraphs. We used the program vg [@garrison2018] to deconstruct each graph\nassembly into a VCF containing the variation encapsulated in each graph.\nWe passed this deconstructed VCF file to vcfbub\n(github.com/pangenome/vcfbub) to collapse nested SV sites into the\ntop-level variant for all SV less than 10kb in length. Using bcftools\n[@danecek2021] we split biallelic sites into multiallelic records for\nthis deconstructed vcf.\n\n### Genotyping Pan-genomic Variation\n\nWe aligned sequencing reads from additional samples to pan-genome graph\nassembly to genotype SNPs and SVs. We aligned PacBio HiFi reads for 40\ntotal individuals (including the 16 used to construct the pan-genome\ngraph) to the minigraph-cactus graph using the program GraphAligner\n[@rautiainen2020]. To characterize sequence variation across a broader\nset of individuals, we also mapped Illumina short reads for 575\nindividuals to the pan-genome graph using the program giraffe\n[@sirén2021]. We then called SV and SNPs from these alignments using the\nvg call algorithm [@garrison2018]. We used bcftools to split\nmultialleleic calls into separate records, normalize alleles against the\n*P. trichocarpa* reference and merge calls for all samples into one VCF\nrepresenting SV and SNP genotypes in the *P. trichocarpa* reference\ncoordinate space.\n\n### Analysis of Structural Variation and Introgression\n\nWe used ADMIXTURE results from Bolte et al (2024) to assign each\nindividual an admixture proportion at K=2 and K=4. The genetic data used\nfor this ADMIXTURE analysis came from SNP calls from mappings of the\nsame illlumina reads used in this study, however they were mapped to the\n*P. trichocarpa* reference genome. We used this same genetic data set to\nperform local ancestry inference (LAI) using LOTR [@dias2018loter].\nThese ADMIXTURE and LAI data sets were used to visualize and analyze\npatterns of local and global genomic ancestry throughout this study.\n\nWe used ODGI to flatten the Nisqually1 *P. trichocarpa* reference genome\npath in the cactus graph. We then used a bed file representation of this\npath and reference gene annotations to genotype PAV of reference\nsequence across all paths of the cactus graph. We used R version 4.1.0\nto identify core and shell gene sequences from this data and to perform\nPCA on the PAV genotypes [@R]. We also ran a similar PAV PCA with the\nmerged vcf representing all 575 sequenced samples in this study, using\nplink2 [@chang2015second]. We used the -–allele-weights flag to extract\nthe loading of each allele for each SV on the first 3 principal\ncomponents.\n\nTo find SV potentially involved in introgression, we employed custom\nscripts to identify ancestry blocks along the chromosomes of all 335\nadmixed individuals in this study. An individual was considered admixed\nif its k=2 ADMIXTURE score indicated at least 5% admixture genome-wide.\nWe used Bedtools [@quinlan2010bedtools] to find SV that overlapped\nancestry blocks in each admixed individual. We then scored each SV\nallele based on its prevalence in ancestry blocks that contrasted the\naverage global ancestry of an individual.\n\nFor all SV that were outliers in principal component or LAI analyses, we\nused Bedtools to check for overlap with annotated genes. We then used\nplantgenie to analyze PFAM enrichment of gene sets [@sundell2015plant].\n\n## Results\n\n### Whole genome sequencing and assembly.\n\nIllumina sequencing yielded on average of 8358 MB of sequence,\ncorresponding to an average sequencing depth of 21x. PacBio HiFi\nsequencing yielded on average 6368 MB of sequence, corresponding to an\naverage sequencing depth of 16x. Sample 939 was sequenced to a depth of\nroughly 60X HiFi and roughly 20X ONT reads. Table 1 shows summary\nstatistics for the 16 whole genome assemblies included in the\npan-genome. Assembly quality and contiguity were generally high, however\nalternate haplotypes were not always fully assembled (Table 1).\n\n### Pan-genome assembly\n\nThe minigraph-cactus pangenome graph contained a total of 102,907,131\nnodes comprising 1.2 Gbp of sequence. Of this, 243 Mbp was present\nacross all individuals (core genome), while 423Mbp was present in some\nbut not all individuals (shell genome). The remaining 537 Mbp\nrepresented singleton sequence. @fig-2 shows how the size of the\nsequence classes changes as individuals are added to the pan-genome.\n@fig-3 shows the proportions of core, shell and singleton sequence\nwithin each sample. @fig-4 shows each genome in the pan-genome graph\nplotted on the first two principal components of a PCA on PAV of\nreference sequence.\n\n### Pan-genomic Variation\n\n3708 annotated genes were variably present or absent across the 17\ngenomes used to construct the pan- =genome. These genes were\nsignificantly enriched for various protein families including NB-ARC\ndomain, D-mannose binding lectin, sulfotransferases, cupins, and\nCytochrome P450. Of these shell genes, 167 were present in all of the\npure *P. trichocarpa* individuals and none of the pure *P. balsamifera*\nsamples making up the pan-genome graph. These *P. trichocarpa* -\nspecific genes were enriched for protein families, including\nsulfotransferases, serine carboxypeptidases, Mlo family proteins,\nD-mannose binding lectin, Glycosyl hydrolases and absistic acid (ABA)\ninduced proteins.\n\nThe cactus pan-genome graph contained 1,773,427 SV greater than 20bp in\nlength. @fig-5 shows the distribution of these variants across the\ngenome. The distribution of frequencies of the non-reference allele for\nthese SV is shown in @fig-6.\n\nThe first two principal components of a PCA on PAV genotyped from short\nread alignments to the pan-genome graph are shown in @fig-7. The loading\nof each allele for each SV on the first principal component of a PCA on\nPAV genotyped from short read alignments to the pan-genome graph is\nshown in @fig-8. The SV that were outliers on PC1 overlapped 1362\nannotated genes. These genes were significantly enriched for protein\nfamilies involved in development and growth (K-Box proteins, KNOX\nproteins), cold tolerance (DEAD/DEAH box helicases), and phenology (SRF\ntranscription factors).\n\n### SV and Introgression\n\nWe identified 126,973 SV that overlapped ancestry blocks in admixed\nindividuals, and found that 30,721 of these were associated with blocks\nof either *P. trichocarpa* or *P. balsamifera* ancestry in admixed\nindividuals.\n\n### Tables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code
